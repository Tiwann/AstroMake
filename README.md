# Astro Make

## Introduction
Astro Make is a simple and fast build tool that generates
visual studio solutions and projects. <br>
It works like premake and cmake but it uses C# scripts to describe a solution for generation. 
The idea is to keep the scripts writing and reading as simple and fast as possible. <br>
Using C# helps for syntax highlighting and code completion. When running AstroMake it seaches for '.Astro.cs' files
